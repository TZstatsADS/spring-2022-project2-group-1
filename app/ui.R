                <h5>The pandemic did have an ubiquitous impact over the lives of New Yorkers and that was evident in the NYC311 call patterns from 2019 to 2022.</h5>
                <h5>The network diagrams indicated that residential and payment-related issues were the dominant call types pre-pandemic but transited to 
                <br>Covid-related calls at the onset of the pandemic. Throughout the pandemic, we saw an increase in calls pertaining to social distancing 
                <br>guidelines, symptoms and prevention, assistance in food delivery programs and livelihood, and vaccine-related matters. But as the pandemic 
                <br>waxed and waned the dominant issues that occurred pre-pandemic started to surface again.</h5>
                <h5>Also, the call complaint types changed over time in accordance with the Covid-19 health mandates. For example, during the early phases of 
                <br>the pandemic, businesses were ordered to shut down, and this resulted in high call volumes regarding non-compliance with phased opening, 
                <br>leading us to believe that most businesses were not in compliance with health mandates. During the later phases of the pandemic, however, 
                <br>the calls were mostly on vaccine and face covering violations, which is a consequence of recent vaccine and masking mandates.</h5>
                <h5>The correlation between Covid-19 and non-Covid-19 calls were interesting to note as well. For instance, many construction-related
                <br>complaints were clustered together and were negatively correlated with Covid-19 non-essential construction because residents could not do 
                <br>anything about it because non-essential work were not permitted (the high number of complaints were also corroborated by the network diagrams).</h5>"
